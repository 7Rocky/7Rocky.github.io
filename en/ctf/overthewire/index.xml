The lab consists of 9 levels, using a Linux/x86 architecture (all protections are disabled: NX, PIE, canaries, and even ASLR).
To connect to the first level, we are provided with the SSH credentials for maze0.
The initial recognition of the machine tells us that we have some SUID binaries that will be exploited to pass to the next level.</description></item></channel></rss>
