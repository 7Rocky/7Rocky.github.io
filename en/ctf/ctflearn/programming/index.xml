We can take a look at the first lines of the file:
$ head data.dat 0001100000101010100 110101000001111 101100011001110111 0111111010100 1010111111100011 1110011110010110 11100101010110111 10101101011 1111011101001 0001110001 Alright. The idea is to iterate the file on each line and add 1 to a counter (initialized with 0) if the condition is satisfied.</description></item></channel></rss>
