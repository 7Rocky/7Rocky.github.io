This binary uses an external library that we can modify because of its permissions and gain access as r4j. Finally, there&amp;rsquo;s another binary that runs a local socket server, we can access the binary and analyze it to find out a Buffer Overflow vulnerability. The binary has all protections set, but it is still exploitable to get RCE as root</description></item><item><title>Forest</title><link>https://7rocky.github.io/en/htb/forest/</link><pubDate>Sat, 21 Mar 2020 00:00:00 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://7rocky.github.io/en/htb/forest/</guid><description>Hack The Box. Windows. Easy machine. This machine presents an Active Directory (AD) environment to perform MS RPC enumeration, AS-REProasting, password decrypting, DCSync and Pass the Hash. Basic AD enumeration and exploitation skills, as well as BloodHound knowledge, are needed to compromise this machine</description></item><item><title>Netmon</title><link>https://7rocky.github.io/en/htb/netmon/</link><pubDate>Sat, 29 Jun 2019 00:00:00 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://7rocky.github.io/en/htb/netmon/</guid><description>Hack The Box. Windows. Easy machine. This machine presents an instance of PRTG Network Monitor which is vulnerable to RCE as system. We can connect to FTP with anonymous credentials and read the backup for a configuration file for PRTG Network Monitor and get an old password, which provides a format to guess the current password. Then we can run the public exploit to get RCE and become Administrator</description></item><item><title>Frolic</title><link>https://7rocky.github.io/en/htb/frolic/</link><pubDate>Sat, 23 Mar 2019 00:00:00 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://7rocky.github.io/en/htb/frolic/</guid><description>Hack The Box. Linux. Easy machine. This machine has a website that stores some files with different encodings and esoteric languages. In the end, we reach to a PlaySMS instance that is vulnerable to RCE using PHP. The machine has a SUID binary that is vulnerable to Buffer Overflow and leads to privilege escalation</description></item><item><title>Active</title><link>https://7rocky.github.io/en/htb/active/</link><pubDate>Sat, 08 Dec 2018 00:00:00 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://7rocky.github.io/en/htb/active/</guid><description>Hack The Box.

We can access to the manager using default credentials and get Remote Code Execution on the machine as Administrator</description></item><item><title>Mirai</title><link>https://7rocky.github.io/en/htb/mirai/</link><pubDate>Sat, 10 Feb 2018 00:00:00 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://7rocky.github.io/en/htb/mirai/</guid><description>Hack The Box. Linux. Easy machine. This machine is a Raspberry Pi device that is configured with default credentials, so we can access through SSH and become root because we belong to group sudo. To get the root.txt flag, we need to do a raw copy of a USB stick</description></item><item><title>Blue</title><link>https://7rocky.github.io/en/htb/blue/</link><pubDate>Sat, 13 Jan 2018 00:00:00 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://7rocky.github.io/en/htb/blue/</guid><description>Hack The Box.
