Linux. Insane machine. This machine has a website that is able to analyze malware binaries. Analyzing the sandbox C code, we notice that we can use a log file to exfiltrate information through the web server report, and also abuse a misconfiguration to escape from chroot. Then, we can read a SQLite database file and extract a hashed password, which is reused for SSH. Once inside the machine, we are able to run a SUID binary from inside the sandbox and copy a malicious shared library so that the SUID binary runs Bash as root. Deep knowledge about Linux, programming in C and Bash, code audit experience and escaping techniques is needed in order to compromise this machine. This write-up uses a custom Bash script with an embedded C program to list directories and read files from the server and also a Go program to crack a hashed password</description></item><item><title>Rope</title><link>https://7rocky.github.io/en/htb/rope/</link><pubDate>Sat, 23 May 2020 00:00:00 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://7rocky.github.io/en/htb/rope/</guid><description>Hack The Box. Linux. Insane machine. This machine exposes a custom web server that is vulnerable to Directory Path Traversal so we can read files and discover that it is a binary file. After ananlyzing the binary, we discover that it has a Format String vulnerability that can be exploited to get RCE as john. This user is able to run another binary as user r4j. This binary uses an external library that we can modify because of its permissions and gain access as r4j. Finally, there&amp;rsquo;s another binary that runs a local socket server, we can access the binary and analyze it to find out a Buffer Overflow vulnerability. The binary has all protections set, but it is still exploitable to get RCE as root</description></item></channel></rss>
