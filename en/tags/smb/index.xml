Windows. Easy machine. This machine presents an Active Directory (AD) environment where we can find an encrypted ZIP file in SMB. We can crack the password and find a PFX file holding public and private keys for WinRM. Again we can crack the password and extract the keys to connect to the machine. There is a PowerShell history where we find a password for a LAPS reader member, which will tell us the password for Administrator. Basic Windows exploitation techniques and enumeration are needed in order to compromise this machine</description></item><item><title>Driver</title><link>https://7rocky.github.io/en/htb/driver/</link><pubDate>Sat, 26 Feb 2022 00:00:00 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://7rocky.github.io/en/htb/driver/</guid><description>Hack The Box. Windows. Easy machine. This machine contains a website with default credentials authentication and a file upload. Here we can upload an SCF to capture the user&amp;rsquo;s NTLMv2 hash and crack it. Then we can exploit PrintNightmare. Windows basic exploitation techniques are needed in order to compromise this machine</description></item><item><title>Writer</title><link>https://7rocky.github.io/en/htb/writer/</link><pubDate>Sat, 11 Dec 2021 00:00:00 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://7rocky.github.io/en/htb/writer/</guid><description>Hack The Box. Linux. Medium machine. This machine contains a website that is vulnerable to SQL injection. This allows to read the source code of the server and find a vulnerability. Then some command injection techniques to escalate privileges. Some scripting for automating a SQLi exploit, SMB, SMTP and Cron tasks are needed to compromise the machine. This write-up uses custom Python scripts for SQLi and for the foothold</description></item><item><title>Intelligence</title><link>https://7rocky.github.io/en/htb/intelligence/</link><pubDate>Sat, 27 Nov 2021 00:00:00 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://7rocky.github.io/en/htb/intelligence/</guid><description>Hack The Box. Windows. Medium machine. This machine presents an Active Directory (AD) environment to perform user enumeration, network poisoning and a Silver Ticket attack. Some scripting, DNS operations, AD attacks and BloodHound basics are needed to compromise this machine. This write-up uses a custom Go script to fuzz for files in a web server</description></item><item><title>Active</title><link>https://7rocky.github.io/en/htb/active/</link><pubDate>Sat, 08 Dec 2018 00:00:00 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://7rocky.github.io/en/htb/active/</guid><description>Hack The Box. Windows. Easy machine. This machine presents an Active Directory (AD) environment to perform SMB enumeration, password decrypting and Kerberoasting. Basic AD enumeration and exploitation skills are needed to compromise this machine</description></item><item><title>Blue</title><link>https://7rocky.github.io/en/htb/blue/</link><pubDate>Sat, 13 Jan 2018 00:00:00 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://7rocky.github.io/en/htb/blue/</guid><description>Hack The Box. Windows. Easy machine. This machine exposes SMB version 1, which is vulnerable to EternalBlue. Once the exploit is done, we get access as Administrator</description></item><item><title>Lame</title><link>https://7rocky.github.io/en/htb/lame/</link><pubDate>Sun, 18 Jun 2017 00:00:00 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://7rocky.github.io/en/htb/lame/</guid><description>Hack The Box. Linux. Easy machine. This machine exposes vulnerable versions for FTP and SMB services. The SMB service is exploitable and derives in RCE as root</description></item></channel></rss>
