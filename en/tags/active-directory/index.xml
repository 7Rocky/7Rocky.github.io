Windows. Medium machine. This machine shares a PDF file via SMB and shows credentials to access Microsoft SQL Server. Here, we are able to use &lt;code>xp_dirtree&lt;/code> to list an external SMB share and crack the NTLMv2 hash. After that, we can access the machine, read the logs of Microsoft SQL Server and discover the password of another user. Then, we find some vulnerable certificate templates that can be abused to authenticate as &lt;code>Administrator&lt;/code></description></item><item><title>Timelapse</title><link>https://7rocky.github.io/en/htb/timelapse/</link><pubDate>Sat, 20 Aug 2022 00:00:00 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://7rocky.github.io/en/htb/timelapse/</guid><description>Hack The Box. Windows. Easy machine. This machine presents an Active Directory (AD) environment where we can find an encrypted ZIP file in SMB. We can crack the password and find a PFX file holding public and private keys for WinRM. Again we can crack the password and extract the keys to connect to the machine. There is a PowerShell history where we find a password for a LAPS reader member, which will tell us the password for Administrator. Basic Windows exploitation techniques and enumeration are needed in order to compromise this machine</description></item><item><title>Acute</title><link>https://7rocky.github.io/en/htb/acute/</link><pubDate>Sat, 16 Jul 2022 00:00:00 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://7rocky.github.io/en/htb/acute/</guid><description>Hack The Box. Windows. Hard machine. This machine exposes a website where we can find a Word document with useful information and some usernames. There is a PowerShell Web Access where we can access using a default credential and extract another password from a screenshot. There is an Active Directory domain controller where we can execute commands as other users. We will be able to connect to the first machine and dump NTLM hashes and finally become domain administrator. Deep knowledge on PowerShell commands and basic Windows and Active Directory exploitation techniques are needed in order to compromise this machine</description></item><item><title>Intelligence</title><link>https://7rocky.github.io/en/htb/intelligence/</link><pubDate>Sat, 27 Nov 2021 00:00:00 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://7rocky.github.io/en/htb/intelligence/</guid><description>Hack The Box. Windows. Medium machine. This machine presents an Active Directory (AD) environment to perform user enumeration, network poisoning and a Silver Ticket attack. Some scripting, DNS operations, AD attacks and BloodHound basics are needed to compromise this machine. This write-up uses a custom Go script to fuzz for files in a web server</description></item><item><title>Forest</title><link>https://7rocky.github.io/en/htb/forest/</link><pubDate>Sat, 21 Mar 2020 00:00:00 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://7rocky.github.io/en/htb/forest/</guid><description>Hack The Box. Windows. Easy machine. This machine presents an Active Directory (AD) environment to perform MS RPC enumeration, AS-REP Roasting, password decrypting, DCSync and Pass the Hash. Basic AD enumeration and exploitation skills, as well as BloodHound knowledge, are needed to compromise this machine</description></item><item><title>Active</title><link>https://7rocky.github.io/en/htb/active/</link><pubDate>Sat, 08 Dec 2018 00:00:00 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://7rocky.github.io/en/htb/active/</guid><description>Hack The Box.
