Linux. Medium machine. This machine offers an APK file that contains hard-coded authentication tokens for some services exposed by the machine. One of the tokens can be used to enumerate a Let&amp;rsquo;s Chat application using its API and get credentials for Cachet. This service is vulnerable to Server-Side Template Injection in PHP and we can get more credentials to access via SSH. The machine has a Cron job configured to analyze APK files using a Bash script that is vulnerable to command injection, so we need to upload a maliciously crafted APK file to exploit it and become root</description></item><item><title>RouterSpace</title><link>https://7rocky.github.io/en/htb/routerspace/</link><pubDate>Sat, 09 Jul 2022 00:00:00 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://7rocky.github.io/en/htb/routerspace/</guid><description>Hack The Box. Linux. Easy machine. This machine has a downloadable APK file with a simple app. This app performs a web request to an API the needs th be captured with a proxy, and this API is vulnerable to a command injection. After that, we can access to the machine via SSH and basic enumeration shows that the version of sudo is vulnerable</description></item><item><title>Unicode</title><link>https://7rocky.github.io/en/htb/unicode/</link><pubDate>Sat, 07 May 2022 00:00:00 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://7rocky.github.io/en/htb/unicode/</guid><description>Hack The Box. Linux. Medium machine. This machine uses JWT tokens with JWKS and JKU that can be forged to arrive to a directory path traversal vulnerability that can be exploited using some Unicode bypassing. After that, there is a Python compiled binary that can be run with sudo and uses curl behind the hoods. Some JWT knowledge, path traversal and command injection bypassing techniques are needed to compromise this machine. This write-up uses a custom Python script to exploit a directory path traversal using JWT with JWKS</description></item><item><title>Secret</title><link>https://7rocky.github.io/en/htb/secret/</link><pubDate>Sat, 26 Mar 2022 00:00:00 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://7rocky.github.io/en/htb/secret/</guid><description>Hack The Box. Linux. Easy Machine. This machine contains an API that uses JWT tokens for authentication. We can download the proyect and discover that it is a Git repository, so that we can see the secret key in previous commits and exploit a command injection vulnerability. There is a SUID binary that reads files as root although it only shows some statistics of the file, but we are able to kill the process and read the coredump. Web exploitation techniques, Git enumeration and knowledge about Linux processes are needed in order to compromise this machine</description></item><item><title>Stacked</title><link>https://7rocky.github.io/en/htb/stacked/</link><pubDate>Sat, 19 Mar 2022 00:00:00 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://7rocky.github.io/en/htb/stacked/</guid><description>Hack The Box. Linux. Insane machine. This machine contains a LocalStack environment that is vulnerable to CSRF and command injection. By discovering an XSS vulnerability in a subdomain, we can use CSRF to exploit the command injection vulnerability and get RCE inside a container. After escalating privileges inside the container by restarting a service and entering a malicious command, we can interact with Docker from the host machine and create a malicious container from scratch that mounts the host file system into the container to get arbitrary file read and write. Web exploitation techniques and deep Docker knowledge is needed in order to compromise this machine</description></item><item><title>Devzat</title><link>https://7rocky.github.io/en/htb/devzat/</link><pubDate>Sat, 12 Mar 2022 00:00:00 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://7rocky.github.io/en/htb/devzat/</guid><description>Hack The Box. Linux. Medium machine. This machine contains chat service over SSH and a hidden web subdomain vulnerable to command injection. Then we can access the machine and exploit a vulnerable version of InluxDB to extract the password for another user. This user has permissions to see a development project for the SSH chat that allows to read arbitrary files from the server. Basic web exploitation and Linux enumeration techniques are needed in order to compromise this machine</description></item><item><title>Noter</title><link>https://7rocky.github.io/en/htb/noter/</link><pubDate>Wed, 09 Mar 2022 00:00:00 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://7rocky.github.io/en/htb/noter/</guid><description>Hack The Box. Linux. Medium machine. This machine has a web application built with Flask to manage notes in Markdown and PDF. We are able to extract the secret key used to sign session cookies and then forge cookies to enumerate users. Once we have a privileged user, we can access the FTP server and analyze the source code of the web application to detect a command injection vulnerability. Then, we can access the machine and find out that MySQL runs as root, which leads to privilege escalation</description></item><item><title>Previse</title><link>https://7rocky.github.io/en/htb/previse/</link><pubDate>Sat, 08 Jan 2022 00:00:00 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://7rocky.github.io/en/htb/previse/</guid><description>Hack The Box. Linux. Easy machine. This machine has a webpage vulnerable to command injection after bypassing redirects and managing to register a new account. After that, a hash must be cracked to login as a low privileged user and perform a PATH hijacking using sudo. Common web pentesting and Burp Suite skills, as well as common privilege escalation techniques are needed to compromise the machine. This write-up uses a custom Go program to automate the foothold process</description></item><item><title>Writer</title><link>https://7rocky.github.io/en/htb/writer/</link><pubDate>Sat, 11 Dec 2021 00:00:00 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://7rocky.github.io/en/htb/writer/</guid><description>Hack The Box. Linux. Medium machine. This machine contains a website that is vulnerable to SQL injection. This allows to read the source code of the server and find a vulnerability. Then some command injection techniques to escalate privileges. Some scripting for automating a SQLi exploit, SMB, SMTP and Cron tasks are needed to compromise the machine. This write-up uses custom Python scripts for SQLi and for the foothold</description></item><item><title>Pikaboo</title><link>https://7rocky.github.io/en/htb/pikaboo/</link><pubDate>Sat, 04 Dec 2021 00:00:00 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://7rocky.github.io/en/htb/pikaboo/</guid><description>Hack The Box. Linux. Hard machine. This machine uses nginx and Apache web servers with a misconfiguration that derives in directory path traversal and afterwards in local file inclusion. There are credentials for FTP in LDAP and a Cron job that is vulnerable to command injection. Web enumeration, knowledge about nginx and LDAP, file inclusion techniques and command injection tricks are needed to compromise this machine. This write-up uses a custom Python script to compromise the entire machine from scratch</description></item><item><title>Union</title><link>https://7rocky.github.io/en/htb/union/</link><pubDate>Mon, 22 Nov 2021 00:00:00 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://7rocky.github.io/en/htb/union/</guid><description>Hack The Box.
