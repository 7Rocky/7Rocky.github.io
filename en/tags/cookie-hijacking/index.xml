Linux. Medium machine. This machine has a website that is vulnerable to password reset poisoning and web cache poisoning. Both vulnerabilities can be used to gain access with a normal account and then get the administrator&amp;rsquo;s cookie, respectively. After that, we can read a ticket with SSH credentials. Then, we can run a Machine Learning script as &lt;code>root&lt;/code> using &lt;code>sudo&lt;/code>, and there is a library with a vulnerable version where we can inject Python code to escalate privileges</description></item><item><title>Pandora</title><link>https://7rocky.github.io/en/htb/pandora/</link><pubDate>Sat, 21 May 2022 00:00:00 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://7rocky.github.io/en/htb/pandora/</guid><description>Hack The Box. Linux. Easy machine. This machine exposes sensitive information through SNMP that allows to access the machine. Then we find a local instance of Pandora FMS that has multiple vulnerabilities and they can be exploited to gain RCE as another user. This user is allowed to run a SUID binary that is vulnerable to PATH hijacking, but the attack needs to be performed with an SSH shell. Basic enumeration and pentesting skills are needed in order to compromise this machine</description></item></channel></rss>
