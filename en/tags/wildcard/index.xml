Linux. Easy machine. This machine has a website that is vulnerable to NoSQL injection. Using this vulnerability, we can bypass authentication. Then, we have a feature to convert an HTML output into PDF, being able to perform a Server-Side XSS attack to read files from the server, such as source code. Then we find a plaintext password that is reused in SSH. Finally, a user is able to run Node.js scripts with &lt;code>sudo&lt;/code> in a path that matches a wildcard.

Linux. Medium machine. This machine uses a dynamic DNS service vulnerable to command injection and then the machine has sudo permissions for a command that uses a wildard. DNS knowledge, command injection techniques and wildcard abusing skills are needed to compromise this machine</description></item></channel></rss>
