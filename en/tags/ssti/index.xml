Linux. Medium machine. This machine contains a website that exposes Git repository with secrets in old commits. There is a website that needs a valid JWT token in order to exploit an SSTI vulnerability. The secret for the JWT tokens is stored in an AWS Lambda function. Then, there is a Cron job that can be exploited using symlinks to gain arbitrary read. Knowledge about Git, JWT, SSTI and AWS Lambda, as well as Cron job exploitation, is needed to compromise this machine</description></item><item><title>Nunchucks</title><link>https://7rocky.github.io/en/htb/nunchucks/</link><pubDate>Tue, 02 Nov 2021 00:00:00 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://7rocky.github.io/en/htb/nunchucks/</guid><description>Hack The Box. Linux. Easy machine. This machine has a webpage vulnerable to Server-Side Template Injection (SSTI) and system capabilities set, but with some protections. Knowledge about Node.js templates and Perl are needed to compromise this machine</description></item><item><title>Spider</title><link>https://7rocky.github.io/en/htb/spider/</link><pubDate>Sat, 23 Oct 2021 00:00:00 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://7rocky.github.io/en/htb/spider/</guid><description>Hack The Box. Linux. Hard machine. This machine contains a website that is vulnerable to Server-Side Template Injection (SSTI) in two fields and SQL injection (SQLi), and an internal website that is vulnerable to XML External Entity (XXE) injection. Advanced knowledge on SSTI and bypassing techniques, SQLi, XXE and port forwarding skills are needed to compromise the machine. This write-up uses a Python script to exploit SSTI and a Bash script to read file using XXE</description></item></channel></rss>
