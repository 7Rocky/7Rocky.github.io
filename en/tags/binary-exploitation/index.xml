Windows. Hard machine. This machine contains a webpage that hides a Nuxeo Java application vulnerable to SSTI by breaking nginx parser logic. Then we find access the machine and find an application that has a public exploit to access as another user. After that, we extract Firefox credentials and use a password generator to login as another user and find a custom Windows PE. Having reversed the binary to obtain the expected credentials, we find a Buffer Overflow vulnerability that must be exploited via Socket Reuse to access as Administrator</description></item><item><title>Static</title><link>https://7rocky.github.io/en/htb/static/</link><pubDate>Sat, 18 Dec 2021 00:00:00 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://7rocky.github.io/en/htb/static/</guid><description>Hack The Box. Linux. Hard machine. This machine contains a website that exposes a corrupted Gzip file that must be patched to get a TOTP key and download a VPN file. Then there are some PHP vulnerable services that can be compromised and get to an internal server that contains a binary executable file having a Format String vulnerability. Deep knowledge about pivoting and port forwarding techniques, network enumeration and PHP exploitation, as well as Format String exploitation are needed to compromise this machine. This write-up uses a custom Ruby script to automate the process of downloading the VPN file, a Python script gain RCE over a PHP web server and another Python script to exploit a binary using Format String</description></item></channel></rss>
