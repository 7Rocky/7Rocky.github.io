Linux. Insane machine. This machine exposes a web application that allows to create custom domains with HTML code. Moreover, there is a Docker registry exposed where we can download Docker image blobs after getting a suitable JWT token. The web application is running a WAR file with Tomcat, we can decompile it and see that it queries a RMI server. Since Tomcat is behind an nginx reverse proxy, we can access some sensitive Tomcat &lt;em>servlets&lt;/em> to modify our session and set manager permissions on the web application. We need this to modify the RMI configuration using a mass assignment vulnerability and point the RMI server to us. After that, we can exploit an insecure deserialization vulnerability in Java to get RCE in a container. Then, we can interact with the legitimate RMI server using port forwarding. This server allows us to read arbitrary files with a directory traversal attack. We can find a plaintext password for user &lt;code>developer&lt;/code>, which is reused in SSH. Then, &lt;code>root&lt;/code> is executing a JAR file to analyze files of the hosting website by sending them to a ClamAV server. The problem here is that the JAR calls functions from the RMI register, which is restarted periodically. Therefore, we can craft a malicious RMI registry and exploit win a race condition to take the port, so that &lt;code>root&lt;/code> queries our malicious registry and talks to our fake ClamAV server. The result is that all files at &lt;code>/root&lt;/code> will be quarantined inside a readable directory, which leads to the privilege escalation</description></item><item><title>MonitorsTwo</title><link>https://7rocky.github.io/en/htb/monitorstwo/</link><pubDate>Sat, 02 Sep 2023 00:00:00 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://7rocky.github.io/en/htb/monitorstwo/</guid><description>Hack The Box. Linux. Easy machine. This machine has a Cacti service that is vulnerable to unauthenticated Remote Code Execution that grants access to a Docker container. Here we can find credentials in the database and reuse them for SSH on the host machine. Then, we find out that the Docker version is vulnerable to a CVE. To exploit this, we need to get &lt;code>root&lt;/code> in the container and configure a SUID binary that will be executed from the host machine via directory traversal to escalate privileges</description></item><item><title>Stocker</title><link>https://7rocky.github.io/en/htb/stocker/</link><pubDate>Sat, 24 Jun 2023 00:00:00 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://7rocky.github.io/en/htb/stocker/</guid><description>Hack The Box. Linux. Easy machine. This machine has a website that is vulnerable to NoSQL injection. Using this vulnerability, we can bypass authentication. Then, we have a feature to convert an HTML output into PDF, being able to perform a Server-Side XSS attack to read files from the server, such as source code. Then we find a plaintext password that is reused in SSH. Finally, a user is able to run Node.js scripts with &lt;code>sudo&lt;/code> in a path that matches a wildcard. Bypassing this wildcard is needed to escalate privileges</description></item><item><title>Bagel</title><link>https://7rocky.github.io/en/htb/bagel/</link><pubDate>Sat, 03 Jun 2023 00:00:00 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://7rocky.github.io/en/htb/bagel/</guid><description>Hack The Box. Linux. Medium machine. This machine has website that is vulnerable to Local File Read. With this, we can read the web application source code and see that there is a WebSocket server that uses C# .NET with a DLL to process the messages. We can download and reverse the DLL to read the C# source code. The program deserializes JSON data and there is a flaw that allows us to reuse a class of the codebase to read arbitrary files from the server. With this, we can read the private SSH key of a user, and then switch to another user with a password that is also stored in the DLL. This user is able to run &lt;code>dotnet&lt;/code> with &lt;code>sudo&lt;/code>, which can be used to escalate privileges</description></item><item><title>BroScience</title><link>https://7rocky.github.io/en/htb/broscience/</link><pubDate>Sat, 08 Apr 2023 00:00:00 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://7rocky.github.io/en/htb/broscience/</guid><description>Hack The Box. Linux. Medium machine. This machine has a website with a Local File Read vulnerability that can be used to read PHP source code and find a way to activate a new account. Then, we can perform a deserialization attack in PHP to get RCE. After that, we find a hashed password in the database that can be cracked and it is reused in the system. Finally, there&amp;rsquo;s a Cron task running by &lt;code>root&lt;/code> to renew OpenSSL certificates and the script has a command injection vulnerability, which leads to the privilege escalation</description></item><item><title>Awkward</title><link>https://7rocky.github.io/en/htb/awkward/</link><pubDate>Sat, 25 Feb 2023 00:00:00 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://7rocky.github.io/en/htb/awkward/</guid><description>Hack The Box. Linux. Medium machine. This machine has a website built in Vue.js that exposes a login form which can be easily bypassed. Then we find an API endpoint that tests connectivity of other websites, which can be exploited using Server-Side Request Forgery to find an internal API documentation. There we have some Node.js code to analyze and see how we can bypass some checks to obtain all the users information and crack a password hash. After that, we can log in, get a valid JWT token and crack it to find the secret. Therefore, we can forge any JWT token, which means we can inject any payload as token information. Using this power, we can read arbitrary files from the server exploiting &lt;code>awk&lt;/code> and find plaintext credentials inside a compressed archive. Next, we can access via SSH and find out another website built with PHP with two vulnerabilities. There is also a Cron task that takes information from a CSV file to send an email. The key here is to inject a malicious parameter in the CSV file so that the &lt;code>mail&lt;/code> command executes a malicious script, which leads to the privilege escalation</description></item><item><title>Ambassador</title><link>https://7rocky.github.io/en/htb/ambassador/</link><pubDate>Sat, 28 Jan 2023 00:00:00 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://7rocky.github.io/en/htb/ambassador/</guid><description>Hack The Box. Linux. Medium machine. This machine has a Grafana instance that is vulnerable to Directory Path Traversal without authentication. There, we can read files from the server and find the password for Grafana and for MySQL. After that, we can connect to MySQL, which is exposed, and find another password to access via SSH. The machine runs &lt;code>consul&lt;/code> internally with a vulnerable configuration. After finding an authentication token in a Git repository, we can use an exploit to get RCE from &lt;code>consul&lt;/code> and get access as &lt;code>root&lt;/code></description></item><item><title>RedPanda</title><link>https://7rocky.github.io/en/htb/redpanda/</link><pubDate>Sat, 26 Nov 2022 00:00:00 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://7rocky.github.io/en/htb/redpanda/</guid><description>Hack The Box. Linux. Easy machine. This machine contains a web application built with Spring Boot that is vulnerable to Server-Side Template Injection with a particular format. After that, in order to escalate privileges, we must analyze a Java program, enter some malicious metadata in a JPEG image, add an XML External Entity into a controlled XML file, break a log parser logic and finally wait for root to process the XML file and read its private SSH key</description></item><item><title>Trick</title><link>https://7rocky.github.io/en/htb/trick/</link><pubDate>Sat, 29 Oct 2022 00:00:00 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://7rocky.github.io/en/htb/trick/</guid><description>Hack The Box. Linux. Easy machine. This machine has a DNS service that is vulnerable to a Domain Zone Transfer attack and leaks a subdomain. Here we can bypass authentication with SQLi and exploit an LFI. Both vulnerabilities can be chained to get access to the machine. Then, we find another subdomain that is again vulnerable to LFI, and we can leak a user&amp;rsquo;s SSH private key. This user is able to restart fail2ban with sudo and modify configuration files</description></item><item><title>Faculty</title><link>https://7rocky.github.io/en/htb/faculty/</link><pubDate>Sat, 22 Oct 2022 00:00:00 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://7rocky.github.io/en/htb/faculty/</guid><description>Hack The Box. Linux. Medium machine. This machine has a website that is vulnerable to SQLi and autentication bypass which leads to a website where we can export HTML content to PDF. There is a vulnerability where we can attach local files to the PDF file and read a password reused for SSH. Using sudo we can execute a Node.js script as another user and exploit a command injection vulnerability. This second user is allowed to run GDB and moreover GDB has cap_sys_ptrace capability set, so we can debug a process running as root and run arbitrary code</description></item><item><title>OpenSource</title><link>https://7rocky.github.io/en/htb/opensource/</link><pubDate>Sat, 08 Oct 2022 00:00:00 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://7rocky.github.io/en/htb/opensource/</guid><description>Hack The Box. Linux. Easy machine. This machine has a website exposes its source code, being vulnerable to Directory Path Traversal. Using this vulnerability we can read the necessary files to compute the PIN for the Flask debug console and get Remote Code Execution in a Docker container. After that, we need to use port forwarding to view a Gitea instance and enter credentials found in a Git repository. Here we have the private SSH key so we can enter as a system user. There is a Cron job that commits new changes of a Git repository and leads to privilege escalation</description></item><item><title>Scanned</title><link>https://7rocky.github.io/en/htb/scanned/</link><pubDate>Sat, 10 Sep 2022 00:00:00 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://7rocky.github.io/en/htb/scanned/</guid><description>Hack The Box. Linux. Insane machine. This machine has a website that is able to analyze malware binaries. Analyzing the sandbox C code, we notice that we can use a log file to exfiltrate information through the web server report, and also abuse a misconfiguration to escape from chroot. Then, we can read a SQLite database file and extract a hashed password, which is reused for SSH. Once inside the machine, we are able to run a SUID binary from inside the sandbox and copy a malicious shared library so that the SUID binary runs Bash as root. Deep knowledge about Linux, programming in C and Bash, code audit experience and escaping techniques is needed in order to compromise this machine. This write-up uses a custom Bash script with an embedded C program to list directories and read files from the server and also a Go program to crack a hashed password</description></item><item><title>Retired</title><link>https://7rocky.github.io/en/htb/retired/</link><pubDate>Sat, 13 Aug 2022 00:00:00 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://7rocky.github.io/en/htb/retired/</guid><description>Hack The Box. Linux. Medium machine. This machine has a PHP website that is vulnerable to Directory Path Traversal. There we find a PHP file that expects a file to be uploaded in order to be passed to a local socket server. We are able to enumerate open processes and download the binary that runs the server and see that it is vulnerable to Buffer Overflow. Once exploited, we can pivot to another user using symbolic links. And then, we are allowed to add custom executable formats, which can be exploited to become root. Solid binary exploitation techniques and Linux concepts are required in order to compromise this machine. This write-up contains some custom Python exploits for the foothold part</description></item><item><title>OverGraph</title><link>https://7rocky.github.io/en/htb/overgraph/</link><pubDate>Sat, 06 Aug 2022 00:00:00 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://7rocky.github.io/en/htb/overgraph/</guid><description>Hack The Box. Linux. Hard machine. This machine contains a website that is vulnerable to Open Redirect, a web application built with AngularJS which is vulnerable to Client-Side Template Injection and XSS, and a GraphQL endpoint. We are able to register a new account bypassing an OTP code using a NoSQLi payload. Then, we can perform a CSRF attack abusing the Open Redirect to inject an XSS payload on the victim&amp;rsquo;s profile in order to get an adminToken stored in localStorage. After that, we are able to upload video files that are processed with ffmpeg, so we can exploit a Server-Side Request Forgery vulnerability to read files from the server. Eventually, we will access as a user to the machine and find a binary that is running as root. Having analyzed the binary, we can obtain a valid token to use the program and exploit a vulnerability to write arbitrary data at an arbitrary address, leading to RCE or write permissions as root</description></item><item><title>Unicode</title><link>https://7rocky.github.io/en/htb/unicode/</link><pubDate>Sat, 07 May 2022 00:00:00 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://7rocky.github.io/en/htb/unicode/</guid><description>Hack The Box.
