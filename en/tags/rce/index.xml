Linux. Easy machine. This machine contains a web application built with Spring Boot that is vulnerable to Server-Side Template Injection with a particular format. After that, in order to escalate privileges, we must analyze a Java program, enter some malicious metadata in a JPEG image, add an XML External Entity into a controlled XML file, break a log parser logic and finally wait for root to process the XML file and read its private SSH key</description></item><item><title>Shared</title><link>https://7rocky.github.io/en/htb/shared/</link><pubDate>Sat, 12 Nov 2022 00:00:00 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://7rocky.github.io/en/htb/shared/</guid><description>Hack The Box. Linux. Medium machine. This machine has an e-commerce store that is vulnerable to SQLi. With this vulnerability we can get a hashed password which is reused for SSH. There is another user that runs ipython periodically, so we can inject a configuration file to execute commands. The second user is able to use a binary compiled in Go that connects to Redis. A binary analysis reveals the password, so we can connect to Redis and exploit a CVE to run Lua code, escape from the sandbox and execute system commands as root</description></item><item><title>Trick</title><link>https://7rocky.github.io/en/htb/trick/</link><pubDate>Sat, 29 Oct 2022 00:00:00 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://7rocky.github.io/en/htb/trick/</guid><description>Hack The Box.

Linux. Medium machine. This machine has a PHP website that is vulnerable to Directory Path Traversal. There we find a PHP file that expects a file to be uploaded in order to be passed to a local socket server. We are able to enumerate open processes and download the binary that runs the server and see that it is vulnerable to Buffer Overflow. Once exploited, we can pivot to another user using symbolic links. And then, we are allowed to add custom executable formats, which can be exploited to become root. Solid binary exploitation techniques and Linux concepts are required in order to compromise this machine.

Linux. Hard machine. This machine contains a website that is vulnerable to Open Redirect, a web application built with AngularJS which is vulnerable to Client-Side Template Injection and XSS, and a GraphQL endpoint.

After that, we are able to upload video files that are processed with ffmpeg, so we can exploit a Server-Side Request Forgery vulnerability to read files from the server. Eventually, we will access as a user to the machine and find a binary that is running as root. Having analyzed the binary, we can obtain a valid token to use the program and exploit a vulnerability to write arbitrary data at an arbitrary address, leading to RCE or write permissions as root</description></item><item><title>Late</title><link>https://7rocky.github.io/en/htb/late/</link><pubDate>Sat, 30 Jul 2022 00:00:00 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://7rocky.github.io/en/htb/late/</guid><description>Hack The Box.
