Linux. Easy machine. This machine has a WordPress website that uses a plugin that is vulnerable to SQLi. Then we can get password hashes and crack one of them to get access to the WordPress dashboard. The version of WordPress is vulnerable to out-of-band XXE using a WAV file that allows to read files from the server. Using this vulnerability, we can find plaintext credentials for FTP. In this service we have another PHP file with more plaintext credentials that are valid for SSH. Once inside the machine, we can see some PGP keys and messages that can be decrypted to find the password for &lt;code>root&lt;/code></description></item><item><title>Paper</title><link>https://7rocky.github.io/en/htb/paper/</link><pubDate>Sat, 18 Jun 2022 00:00:00 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://7rocky.github.io/en/htb/paper/</guid><description>Hack The Box. Linux. Easy machine. This machine contains a WordPress website that has some secret information hidden in draft posts, and also a chat bot that shows sensitive information. After that, the server happens to be vulnerable to PolKit. WordPress enumeration is needed to compromise the machine</description></item><item><title>Backdoor</title><link>https://7rocky.github.io/en/htb/backdoor/</link><pubDate>Sat, 23 Apr 2022 00:00:00 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://7rocky.github.io/en/htb/backdoor/</guid><description>Hack The Box. Linux. Easy machine. This machine contains a WordPress website that has a plugin vulnerable to Directory Path Traversal, which can be used to enumerate running processes, and then a SUID binary. WordPress enumeration and experience with file inclusion vulnerabilities is needed to compromise the machine. This write-up uses a custom Python script to read files from the server and a personal public exploit to gain access to the machine</description></item><item><title>Monitors</title><link>https://7rocky.github.io/en/htb/monitors/</link><pubDate>Sat, 09 Oct 2021 00:00:00 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://7rocky.github.io/en/htb/monitors/</guid><description>Hack The Box. Linux. Hard machine. This machine has a WordPress web site with a plugin vulnerable to Directory Path Traversal, another website vulnerable to SQL injection, and yet another webpage vulnerable to Insecure Deserialization running inside a Docker container with system capabilities enabled. Deep knowledge about web enumeration, vulnerabilities and exploitation techniques, as well as port forwarding and Docker escaping methods are needed to compromise this machine. This write-up uses a custom Bash script to exploit Insecure Deserialization</description></item></channel></rss>
