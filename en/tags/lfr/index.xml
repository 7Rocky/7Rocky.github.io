Linux. Easy machine. This machine has a website that is vulnerable to NoSQL injection. Using this vulnerability, we can bypass authentication. Then, we have a feature to convert an HTML output into PDF, being able to perform a Server-Side XSS attack to read files from the server, such as source code. Then we find a plaintext credential that is reused in SSH. Finally, a user is able to run Node.js scripts with sudo in a path that matches a wildcard. Bypassing this wildcard is needed to escalate privileges. This write-up uses a Python script to extract values using RegEx and NoSQLi</description></item><item><title>Bagel</title><link>https://7rocky.github.io/en/htb/bagel/</link><pubDate>Sat, 03 Jun 2023 00:00:00 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://7rocky.github.io/en/htb/bagel/</guid><description>Hack The Box. Linux. Medium machine. This machine has website that is vulnerable to Local File Read. With this, we can read the web application source code and see that there is a WebSocket server that uses C# .NET with a DLL to process the messages. We can download and reverse the DLL to read the C# source code. The program deserializes JSON data and there is a flaw that allows us to reuse a class of the codebase to read arbitrary files from the server. With this, we can read the private SSH key of a user, and then switch to another user with a password that is also stored in the DLL. This user is able to run &lt;code>dotnet&lt;/code> with &lt;code>sudo&lt;/code>, which can be used to escalate privileges</description></item><item><title>MetaTwo</title><link>https://7rocky.github.io/en/htb/metatwo/</link><pubDate>Sat, 29 Apr 2023 00:00:00 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://7rocky.github.io/en/htb/metatwo/</guid><description>Hack The Box. Linux. Easy machine. This machine has a WordPress website that uses a plugin that is vulnerable to SQLi. Then we can get password hashes and crack one of them to get access to the WordPress dashboard. The version of WordPress is vulnerable to out-of-band XXE using a WAV file that allows to read files from the server. Using this vulnerability, we can find plaintext credentials for FTP. In this service we have another PHP file with more plaintext credentials that are valid for SSH. Once inside the machine, we can see some PGP keys and messages that can be decrypted to find the password for &lt;code>root&lt;/code></description></item><item><title>BroScience</title><link>https://7rocky.github.io/en/htb/broscience/</link><pubDate>Sat, 08 Apr 2023 00:00:00 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://7rocky.github.io/en/htb/broscience/</guid><description>Hack The Box. Linux. Medium machine. This machine has a website with a Local File Read vulnerability that can be used to read PHP source code and find a way to activate a new account. Then, we can perform a deserialization attack in PHP to get RCE. After that, we find a hashed password in the database that can be cracked and it is reused in the system. Finally, there&amp;rsquo;s a Cron task running by &lt;code>root&lt;/code> to renew OpenSSL certificates and the script has a command injection vulnerability, which leads to the privilege escalation</description></item><item><title>Awkward</title><link>https://7rocky.github.io/en/htb/awkward/</link><pubDate>Sat, 25 Feb 2023 00:00:00 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://7rocky.github.io/en/htb/awkward/</guid><description>Hack The Box. Linux. Medium machine. This machine has a website built in Vue.js that exposes a login form which can be easily bypassed. Then we find an API endpoint that tests connectivity of other websites, which can be exploited using Server-Side Request Forgery to find an internal API documentation. There we have some Node.js code to analyze and see how we can bypass some checks to obtain all the users information and crack a password hash. After that, we can log in, get a valid JWT token and crack it to find the secret. Therefore, we can forge any JWT token, which means we can inject any payload as token information. Using this power, we can read arbitrary files from the server exploiting &lt;code>awk&lt;/code> and find plaintext credentials inside a compressed archive. Next, we can access via SSH and find out another website built with PHP with two vulnerabilities. There is also a Cron task that takes information from a CSV file to send an email. The key here is to inject a malicious parameter in the CSV file so that the &lt;code>mail&lt;/code> command executes a malicious script, which leads to the privilege escalation</description></item></channel></rss>
