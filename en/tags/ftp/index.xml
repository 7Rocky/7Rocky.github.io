Linux. Hard machine. This machine contains a website that exposes a corrupted GZIP file that must be patched to get a TOTP key and download a VPN file. Then there are some PHP vulnerable services that can be compromised and get to an internal server that contains a binary executable file having a Format String vulnerability. Deep knowledge about pivoting and port forwarding techniques, network enumeration and PHP exploitation, as well as Format String exploitation are needed to compromise this machine. This write-up uses a custom Ruby script to automate the process of downloading the VPN file, a Python script gain RCE over a PHP web server and another Python script to exploit a binary using Format String</description></item><item><title>Pikaboo</title><link>https://7rocky.github.io/en/htb/pikaboo/</link><pubDate>Sat, 04 Dec 2021 00:00:00 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://7rocky.github.io/en/htb/pikaboo/</guid><description>Hack The Box. Linux. Hard machine. This machine uses nginx and Apache web servers with a misconfiguration that derives in directory path traversal and afterwards in local file inclusion. There are credentials for FTP in LDAP and a Cron job that is vulnerable to command injection. Web enumeration, knowledge about nginx and LDAP, file inclusion techniques and command injection tricks are needed to compromise this machine. This write-up uses a custom Python script to compromise the entire machine from scratch</description></item><item><title>Cap</title><link>https://7rocky.github.io/en/htb/cap/</link><pubDate>Sat, 02 Oct 2021 00:00:00 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://7rocky.github.io/en/htb/cap/</guid><description>Hack The Box. Linux. Easy machine. This machine contains Insecure Direct Object Reference (IDOR) and system capabilities. Reading capture files in Wireshark and capabilities enumeration skills are needed to compromise this machine</description></item></channel></rss>
