Linux. Insane machine. This machine exposes a web application that allows to create custom domains with HTML code. Moreover, there is a Docker registry exposed where we can download Docker image blobs after getting a suitable JWT token. The web application is running a WAR file with Tomcat, we can decompile it and see that it queries a RMI server. Since Tomcat is behind an nginx reverse proxy, we can access some sensitive Tomcat &lt;em>servlets&lt;/em> to modify our session and set manager permissions on the web application. We need this to modify the RMI configuration using a mass assignment vulnerability and point the RMI server to us. After that, we can exploit an insecure deserialization vulnerability in Java to get RCE in a container. Then, we can interact with the legitimate RMI server using port forwarding. This server allows us to read arbitrary files with a directory traversal attack. We can find a plaintext password for user &lt;code>developer&lt;/code>, which is reused in SSH. Then, &lt;code>root&lt;/code> is executing a JAR file to analyze files of the hosting website by sending them to a ClamAV server. The problem here is that the JAR calls functions from the RMI register, which is restarted periodically. Therefore, we can craft a malicious RMI registry and exploit win a race condition to take the port, so that &lt;code>root&lt;/code> queries our malicious registry and talks to our fake ClamAV server. The result is that all files at &lt;code>/root&lt;/code> will be quarantined inside a readable directory, which leads to the privilege escalation</description></item><item><title>Newsletter 14/01/2024</title><link>https://7rocky.github.io/en/newsletters/2024-01-14/</link><pubDate>Sun, 14 Jan 2024 00:00:00 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://7rocky.github.io/en/newsletters/2024-01-14/</guid><description>Pilgrimage Hack The Box.

Using this power, we can read arbitrary files from the server exploiting &lt;code>awk&lt;/code> and find plaintext credentials inside a compressed archive. Next, we can access via SSH and find out another website built with PHP with two vulnerabilities. There is also a Cron task that takes information from a CSV file to send an email. The key here is to inject a malicious parameter in the CSV file so that the &lt;code>mail&lt;/code> command executes a malicious script, which leads to the privilege escalation</description></item><item><title>Newsletter 22/02/2023</title><link>https://7rocky.github.io/en/newsletters/2023-02-22/</link><pubDate>Wed, 22 Feb 2023 00:00:00 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://7rocky.github.io/en/newsletters/2023-02-22/</guid><description>RainyDay Hack The Box.

First of all, let&amp;rsquo;s do the math:
$$ \sin{\left(\frac{-\pi}{2}\right)} = -1 \iff \arcsin{(-1)} = \frac{-\pi}{2} $$ Notice that the inverse sine function is bounded: $\frac{-\pi}{2} \leq \arcsin{x} \leq \frac{\pi}{2}$ for $x \in \mathbb{R}$. Therefore:
$$ -\arcsin{(-1)} \cdot 0.2 = - \left(\frac{-\pi}{2}\right) \cdot 0.2 = \frac{\pi}{10} $$ So we are asked for the 10000th-10099th digits of $\pi$.</description></item><item><title>Arranged</title><link>https://7rocky.github.io/en/ctf/other/htb-cyber-apocalypse/arranged/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://7rocky.github.io/en/ctf/other/htb-cyber-apocalypse/arranged/</guid><description>We are given the SageMath source code to encrypt the flag:

After some minor warnings from IDS, you decide to check the logs to see if anything suspicious is happening. Surprised by what you see, you realize that one of your honeypots has been compromised with a cryptominer. As you look at the processes, you discover a backdoor attached to one of them. The backdoor retrieves the private key from the /key route of a C2. It establishes a session by sending an encrypted initialization sequence.</description></item><item><title>Elliptic Labyrinth</title><link>https://7rocky.github.io/en/ctf/htb-challenges/crypto/elliptic-labyrinth/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://7rocky.github.io/en/ctf/htb-challenges/crypto/elliptic-labyrinth/</guid><description>We are provided with the server source code in Python:

There is a feature to use ping command:
The problem might be related to command injection, because probably the server does something like this:
&amp;lt;?php $cmd = 'ping -c 4 ' . $_POST['ip_address']; system($cmd); Maybe not in PHP, but the concept is the same. Hence, we can try and add a semicolon to inject another system command (; id):
There it is, the server is vulnerable to command injection, which derives in Remote Code Execution (RCE).</description></item><item><title>Lost Flag</title><link>https://7rocky.github.io/en/ctf/imaginaryctf/lost-flag/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://7rocky.github.io/en/ctf/imaginaryctf/lost-flag/</guid><description>We have a ZIP file called flag.zip that contains a JPEG image and also a .DS_Store file, which is a temporary file for macOS machines:

cvpbPGS{arkg_gvzr_V'yy_gel_2_ebhaqf_bs_ebg13_GYpXOHqX} We see that the message has more or less the format of a picoCTF flag (picoCTF{...}), due to the fact that there are 4 lowercase and 3 uppercase letters before {, and ends with }. Moreover, there are several _.
It seems clear that the encryption is based on a substitution algorithm (Caesar cipher). The most common algorithm is ROT13. Using CyberChef, we can decrypt the message using ROT13 and read the flag:</description></item><item><title>Model E1337 - Rolling Code Lock</title><link>https://7rocky.github.io/en/ctf/hacker101ctf/model-e1337---rolling-code-lock/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://7rocky.github.io/en/ctf/hacker101ctf/model-e1337---rolling-code-lock/</guid><description>We have a simple website that requests a code to unlock:

Review of the challenge The server creates a polynomial with random 256-bit coefficients:
$$ P(x) = \mathrm{key} + a_1 x + a_2 x^2 + \dots + a_{30} x^{30} $$ The objective is to find $\mathrm{key}$, which is used to derive an AES key to encrypt the flag. The server allows us to evaluate the polynomial 19 times with values of $0 &amp;lt; x \leqslant 2^{15}$.</description></item><item><title>Multipage Recyclings</title><link>https://7rocky.github.io/en/ctf/htb-challenges/crypto/multipage-recyclings/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://7rocky.github.io/en/ctf/htb-challenges/crypto/multipage-recyclings/</guid><description>We are provided with the server source code in Python:

Looking at the characters and the name of the challenge, we can guess that it is the result of encoding a certain string multiple times in Base64.
Since there are a lot of encoding processes, we can use a loop in Bash until we find the flag in plain text:
$ f=$(cat flag.txt); while true; do if [[ $f = CTFlearn* ]]; then echo $f; break; fi; f=$(echo $f | base64 -d); done CTFlearn{pr3tty_b4s1c_r1ght?</description></item><item><title>Sound of Silence</title><link>https://7rocky.github.io/en/ctf/other/htb-cyber-apocalypse/sound-of-silence/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://7rocky.github.io/en/ctf/other/htb-cyber-apocalypse/sound-of-silence/</guid><description>We are given a 64-bit binary called sound_of_silence:

$ python3 -q &amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; from pwn import xor &amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; c = b'* 7%8-s70&amp; 61&amp;&amp;gt;' &amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; k = xor(c[0], b'i') &amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; m = xor(c, k) &amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; m b'ictf{n0tsecure}'</description></item><item><title>xorrot</title><link>https://7rocky.github.io/en/ctf/imaginaryctf/xorrot/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://7rocky.github.io/en/ctf/imaginaryctf/xorrot/</guid><description>We are given this source code to encrypt the flag, and also the ciphertext as a comment in the code:
#!/usr/bin/env python3 flag = open('flag.txt', 'rb').read() key = open('/dev/urandom','rb').read(1)[0] out = [] for c in flag: out.append(c ^ key) key = c print(f'{bytes(out).hex() = }') # bytes(out).hex() = '970a17121d121d2b28181a19083b2f021d0d03030e1526370d091c2f360f392b1c0d3a340e1c263e070003061711013b32021d173a2b1c090f31351f06072b2b1c0d3a390f1b01072b3c0b09132d33030311' From the source code, we see that the key is a single byte. Moreover, the key is updated with the current plain text character.</description></item><item><title>yaonet</title><link>https://7rocky.github.io/en/ctf/other/dicectf/yaonet/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://7rocky.github.io/en/ctf/other/dicectf/yaonet/</guid><description>We are given two files id_ecdsa, id_ecdsa.pub and a remote instance to connect using SSH:
